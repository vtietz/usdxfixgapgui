Fix GPU Pack detection in PyInstaller builds via runtime hooks

**Problem:**
Built executables (PyInstaller) were not detecting GPU Pack even when installed:
- PyInstaller bundles torch into the executable
- Bundled torch loads before GPU bootstrap can run
- sys.modules clearing caused DLL conflicts and hangs
- GPU acceleration unavailable in production builds

**Solution:**
Implemented PyInstaller runtime hook that runs BEFORE any imports:
1. Created hook-rthook-gpu-pack.py to manipulate sys.path early
2. Checks if GPU Pack installed and enabled via config.ini
3. Adds GPU Pack to sys.path[0] BEFORE bundled torch loads
4. Removes _MEIPASS from sys.path, re-adds at end
5. Sets platform-specific library paths (Windows DLL, Linux LD_LIBRARY_PATH, macOS DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH)

**Changes:**
- NEW: hook-rthook-gpu-pack.py - PyInstaller runtime hook for GPU Pack support
  - Cross-platform config detection (Windows/Linux/macOS)
  - Early sys.path manipulation before torch import
  - Platform-specific shared library path configuration
- MODIFIED: usdxfixgap.spec - Register runtime hook
- MODIFIED: src/utils/gpu_bootstrap/path_installer.py - Removed sys.modules clearing (caused hangs)
- MODIFIED: src/ui/startup_dialog.py - Enhanced GPU status logging with paths and versions
- MODIFIED: README.MD - Added Linux/macOS experimental support notice
- MODIFIED: docs/releases/v1.2.0.md - Added GPU Pack fix note

**Testing:**
✅ Development mode (run.bat start): GPU Pack detected, CUDA available
✅ Production build (exe): GPU Pack detected, CUDA available
⚠️ Linux/macOS: Cross-platform code added but untested

**Technical Notes:**
- Runtime hooks execute before Python imports any modules
- Prevents bundled torch from loading when GPU Pack exists
- Avoids DLL locking issues from module reloading
- Silent fallback if GPU Pack not configured
- Linux/macOS support experimental (LD_LIBRARY_PATH/DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH may not work at runtime)

**Impact:**
- GPU acceleration now works in built executables
- 10-30s processing time vs 2-3 minutes (CPU)
- No breaking changes - graceful fallback to CPU mode
