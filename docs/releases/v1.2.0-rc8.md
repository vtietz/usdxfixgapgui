# v1.2.0-rc8 - Stability & UX Improvements# v1.2.0-rc8 - GPU Bootstrap & Code Quality



## Fixed### Added

- Fix: Task queue viewer crashes when canceling tasks (complete rewrite with simple rebuild pattern)- New: GPU Pack activation option when existing pack detected (no forced re-download)

- Fix: Waveform missing notes overlay on song selection (async race condition resolved)

### Fixed

## Changed- Fix: Restart loop after GPU activation (startup dialog no longer reappears post opt-in)

- Chore: Removed orphaned Debug config section after cleanup- Fix: Stability from safe CPU fallback (avoid torch re-import conflicts)

- Fix: Gap marker positioning and duration calculation accuracy

## Testing- Fix: GPU Pack .zip cleanup after successful extraction (saves disk space)

- All 631 tests passing

- Task queue stability verified under heavy load### Changed

- Change: GPU bootstrap loads pack paths early with graceful fallback if torch preloaded

## What's Next?- Change: Generalized CUDA flavor parsing (cuXYZ → major.minor; e.g. cu124 → 12.4)

Release candidate 8 focuses on stability and user experience improvements based on testing feedback. The task queue is now rock-solid with a clean, simple architecture that avoids complex Qt lifecycle issues.

### Chore

For the complete v1.2.0 feature set, see [v1.2.0.md](v1.2.0.md).- Chore: Code complexity reduced in config initialization, UI components, and build scripts

- Chore: GPU utilities consolidated into modular `utils/gpu/` package structure
- Chore: Consolidated dependency sets (requirements-base.txt + requirements-gpu.txt)
- Chore: Improved code analysis reporting with complexity and style metrics
- Chore: Enhanced logging standards (parameterized format for consistency)
- Chore: Condensed Copilot instructions to essential guide

### Notes
- All tests: 631 passed. Code analysis: complexity, style, and formatting all pass.
