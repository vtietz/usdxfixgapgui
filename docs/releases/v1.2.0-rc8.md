# v1.2.0-rc8 - GPU Bootstrap & Code Quality

### Added
- New: GPU Pack activation option when existing pack detected (no forced re-download)

### Fixed
- Fix: Restart loop after GPU activation (startup dialog no longer reappears post opt-in)
- Fix: Stability from safe CPU fallback (avoid torch re-import conflicts)
- Fix: Gap marker positioning and duration calculation accuracy
- Fix: GPU Pack .zip cleanup after successful extraction (saves disk space)

### Changed
- Change: GPU bootstrap loads pack paths early with graceful fallback if torch preloaded
- Change: Generalized CUDA flavor parsing (cuXYZ → major.minor; e.g. cu124 → 12.4)

### Chore
- Chore: Code complexity reduced in config initialization, UI components, and build scripts
- Chore: GPU utilities consolidated into modular `utils/gpu/` package structure
- Chore: Consolidated dependency sets (requirements-base.txt + requirements-gpu.txt)
- Chore: Improved code analysis reporting with complexity and style metrics
- Chore: Enhanced logging standards (parameterized format for consistency)
- Chore: Condensed Copilot instructions to essential guide

### Notes
- All tests: 631 passed. Code analysis: complexity, style, and formatting all pass.
