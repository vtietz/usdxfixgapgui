# Release Notes v1.1.0

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Storage Location Changed

**Your data will move to a new location on first run:**

- **Windows**: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\USDXFixGap\` (was: app directory)
- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/USDXFixGap/` (follows XDG standard)

**What you need to know:**
- ‚úÖ The app creates new config automatically
- ‚úÖ Old data stays in app directory (not deleted)
- ‚úÖ Optional: Manually copy `config.ini` if you want to keep settings
- ‚úÖ AI models will re-download to new location (~390 MB)

**Why this change?**
- Better multi-user support
- Update-safe storage (your data survives app updates)
- Follows OS conventions and standards

## üöÄ Major Features

### 1. MDX Detection Method (NEW - Now Default!)

**Complete rewrite of vocal detection engine:**
- **5-10x faster** than previous methods
- **More accurate** onset detection using Meta's Demucs AI
- **Smart chunked scanning** - processes only what's needed
- **Energy-based detection** with adaptive thresholds
- **SNR confidence scoring** - know how reliable each detection is

**Performance:**
- **GPU**: 10-30 seconds per song (with optional GPU Pack)
- **CPU**: 30-60 seconds per song
- **Previous method**: 2-3 minutes per song

**Technical improvements:**
- Uses state-of-the-art Demucs vocal separation
- Expanding window search strategy
- Stops as soon as onset found (early exit optimization)
- FP16 precision on GPU for faster inference
- CPU thread optimization (uses N-1 cores)

### 2. GPU Acceleration Support (Optional)

**Optional NVIDIA GPU support for 5-10x faster processing on Windows and Linux:**
- **GPU Pack** - downloadable CUDA runtime (~2.8 GB) with automated installation
- **Auto-detection** of NVIDIA hardware and driver version
- **Cross-platform** - Works on both Windows and Linux
- **Graceful fallback** to CPU if GPU unavailable

**Features:**
- **Windows**: Download from GUI (Settings ‚Üí Download GPU Pack) or CLI `usdxfixgap.exe --setup-gpu`
- **Linux**: Download from CLI `./usdxfixgap --setup-gpu` or install from ZIP
- Offline ZIP installation supported on both platforms
- Per-user installation (LOCALAPPDATA on Windows, ~/.local/share on Linux)
- No admin rights required
- Automatic platform detection (downloads correct wheel for your OS)

**See:** [GPU Acceleration Guide](../gpu-acceleration.md)

### 3. Cross-Platform Storage

**Proper support for Windows and Linux:**
- Follows platform conventions (LOCALAPPDATA, XDG)
- Respects environment variables
- Portable mode fallback
- All user data in one predictable location

**New unified structure:**
```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\USDXFixGap\     (Windows)
~/.local/share/USDXFixGap/     (Linux)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.ini                  # Configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cache.db                    # Song metadata cache
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ usdxfixgap.log              # Application logs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .tmp/                       # Temporary files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ output/                     # Default output
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/                     # AI models (NEW!)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ demucs/                 # Demucs models (~350 MB)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ spleeter/               # Spleeter models (~40 MB)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ gpu_runtime/                # GPU Pack (optional)
```

**Configurable model paths:**
```ini
[Paths]
models_directory = E:\AI_Models          # Custom drive
models_directory = \\server\shared\models # Network share
```
