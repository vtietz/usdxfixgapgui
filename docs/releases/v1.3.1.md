# Release Notes: v1.3.1

**Release Date:** January 18, 2026  
**Type:** Patch Release

## Overview

This patch release fixes a runtime warning that occurred when processing M4A, AAC, or Opus audio files during confidence computation in the gap detection workflow.

## Bug Fixes

### Confidence Computation for Converted Audio Formats

**Issue:** After the introduction of M4A/AAC/Opus support in v1.3.0, users encountered a warning during gap detection: `"name 'torchaudio' is not defined"` when computing confidence scores for converted audio formats.

**Root Cause:** The confidence module was directly calling `torchaudio.info()` instead of using the centralized `audio_compat` layer that handles format conversion for unsupported audio formats.

**Resolution:** Updated `confidence.py` to use `get_audio_info_compat()` from the audio compatibility layer, ensuring consistent handling of all supported audio formats (including M4A/AAC/Opus that require ffmpeg conversion).

**Impact:** Eliminates warnings during gap detection for M4A, AAC, and Opus files; improves user experience for USDB Syncer users who predominantly work with M4A format.

## Upgrade Recommendation

**Recommended for:** All users who upgraded to v1.3.0, especially those working with M4A/AAC/Opus audio files.

**Compatibility:** Drop-in replacement for v1.3.0 with no configuration changes required.
