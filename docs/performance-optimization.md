# Qt TableView Performance Optimization

Performance optimization patterns for Qt Model-View architecture with large datasets (10,000+ items).

---

## Problem Symptoms

- UI freezes during data loading
- Jerky scrolling
- Window resize causing lockup
- Slow filtering and sorting

---

## Three-Layer Optimization Strategy

### **Layer 1: Data Layer Optimizations**

#### **Batch Loading Pattern**
- Emit signals for groups of items (50 at a time) instead of per-item
- Reduces O(n) overhead of individual item signals
- **Impact**: 20-50x faster loading

**Implementation:**
- Workers emit `songsLoadedBatch` with 50 songs at once
- Model uses `add_batch()` method
- Actions handle batch instead of individual songs

#### **Deferred Heavy Processing**
- Load data first, process later
- Avoid synchronous processing during load
- Queue heavy operations for background execution

**Example workflow:**
1. Load song metadata quickly
2. Queue waveform/audio processing as separate tasks
3. Update UI progressively as processing completes

### **Layer 2: Model Layer Optimizations**

#### **Row Caching Pattern**
- Cache `QModelIndex` to avoid repeated lookups
- Reduces O(n) calls during rendering
- **Impact**: 10-20x faster rendering

#### **Coalesced Update Emissions**
- Batch signals with `QTimer.singleShot(0, ...)`
- Combine rapid updates into single signal
- Prevents UI update storms

**Usage:**
- Useful when multiple rapid updates to same model
- Coalesce into single `dataChanged.emit()` call

#### **Optimized Sorting**
- Use `QPersistentModelIndex` during sort operations
- Prevents index invalidation
- Maintains selected rows across sort

#### **Streaming API for Progressive Loading**
- Emit signals as data becomes available
- Don't wait for entire dataset
- Provides early visual feedback

---

### **Layer 3: View Layer Optimizations**

#### **Fast-Path Filtering**
- Quick return for empty filter strings
- Avoid expensive filter operations when not needed

#### **Conditional Column Resizing**
- Only resize columns on initial load
- Don't resize on every data change
- Prevents resize thrashing

#### **Viewport-Only Updates**
- Only update visible rows in table
- Skip processing for off-screen items
- **Impact**: Constant-time updates regardless of total rows

#### **Debounced Updates**
- Add delay before heavy UI updates
- Prevents rapid repeated operations
- Use `QTimer.singleShot()` for debouncing

## Performance Benchmarks

**Without Optimizations:**
- 10,000 songs: 45-60 seconds load time
- UI freezes during load
- Scroll lag, resize lockup

**With Optimizations:**
- 10,000 songs: 3-5 seconds load time
- UI responsive during load
- Smooth scrolling, no lockup

---

## Key Takeaways

**Do:**
- ✅ Batch emit signals (50 items at a time)
- ✅ Defer heavy processing to background
- ✅ Cache row indices to avoid lookups
- ✅ Coalesce rapid updates
- ✅ Use QPersistentModelIndex for sorting
- ✅ Debounce expensive operations
- ✅ Only update visible viewport

**Don't:**
- ❌ Emit signals per item during batch loads
- ❌ Process synchronously during load
- ❌ Resize columns on every update
- ❌ Update off-screen rows
- ❌ Repeatedly re-filter on same criteria
