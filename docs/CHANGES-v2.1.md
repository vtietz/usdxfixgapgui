# USDXFixGap v2.1 - Gap Detection Improvements

## Release Date
October 21, 2025

## Overview
Major improvements to MDX gap detection accuracy, especially for gradual vocal fade-ins and songs with complex intros.

## Detection Algorithm Improvements

### ✅ Better Gradual Fade-In Detection
**Problem**: Songs with gradual vocal fade-ins (like "Disney - Gummibärenbande Theme") were detected too late, missing the actual vocal start.

**Solution**: Changed onset refinement algorithm from "steepest energy rise" to "first consistent rise"
- Increased refinement window from 200ms to 300ms
- Uses adaptive threshold (50% of mean derivative) to find onset start
- Detects the **first** significant energy increase rather than the **maximum** increase
- Works for both abrupt starts AND gradual fade-ins

**Code Changes**:
- `src/utils/providers/mdx/detection.py`: Lines 188-216
- Changed from `np.argmax(energy_derivative)` to iterative first-rise detection

### ✅ Reduced False Positives (Too Early Detection)
**Problem**: Some songs (like "Disney - Chip & Chap Theme") detected onset too early, in instrumental intro or noise.

**Solution**: Balanced threshold adjustments
- Increased `onset_snr_threshold` from 4.0 to 6.5 (more signal required above noise)
- Increased `onset_abs_threshold` from 0.01 to 0.020 (higher minimum energy)
- Increased `noise_floor_duration_ms` from 1000ms to 1200ms (better noise estimation)
- Reduced `min_voiced_duration_ms` from 300ms to 200ms (catch shorter onsets without missing starts)
- Increased `hysteresis_ms` from 200ms to 300ms (look further back for onset)

## Configuration Changes

### Updated MDX Detection Parameters

```ini
[mdx]
# Noise floor estimation
noise_floor_duration_ms = 1200    # Was: 1000

# Detection thresholds  
onset_snr_threshold = 6.5         # Was: 4.0 (too sensitive)
onset_abs_threshold = 0.020       # Was: 0.010 (too low)
min_voiced_duration_ms = 200      # Was: 300 (too long for quick starts)
hysteresis_ms = 300               # Was: 200 (increased look-back)

# Performance
use_fp16 = false                  # Was: true (disabled due to type mismatch)
tf32 = true                       # Enabled for CUDA acceleration
early_stop_tolerance_ms = 500     # Stop scanning when onset found within tolerance
```

### Performance Optimizations

#### ✅ Provider Reuse (Major Performance Gain)
**Problem**: Loading Demucs model 3+ times per detection (vocals, silence, confidence)

**Solution**: Create provider once and pass to all pipeline functions
- `src/utils/gap_detection/pipeline.py`: Provider created once in `perform()`
- Passed to: `get_or_create_vocals()`, `detect_silence_periods()`, `compute_confidence_score()`
- **Result**: Eliminates 2-3 redundant model loads (~5-15s saved per detection)

#### ✅ TF32 Acceleration on CUDA
**Enabled**: `torch.backends.cuda.matmul.allow_tf32 = True`
- 1.5-2x faster matrix operations on Ampere+ GPUs (RTX 30xx, 40xx)
- No accuracy loss for audio processing

#### ✅ Early-Stop Logic
**Problem**: Continued scanning even after finding accurate onset

**Solution**: Stop scanning when onset is within 500ms tolerance
- Reduces unnecessary chunk processing
- Faster detection for songs with accurate metadata

#### ✅ Tighter Initial Scan Window
- `vocal_start_window_sec`: 30s → 20s
- `vocal_window_increment_sec`: 15s → 10s
- `vocal_window_max_sec`: 90s → 60s
- **Result**: ~33% faster initial scanning for accurate metadata

#### ❌ FP16 Disabled (Type Mismatch Issue)
**Problem**: `RuntimeError: Input type (struct c10::Half) and bias type (float) should be the same`

**Cause**: Demucs model has mixed FP16/FP32 weights, causing type conflicts with autocast

**Solution**: Disabled FP16 for now (set `use_fp16 = false`)
- TF32 still provides significant speedup without type issues
- May revisit with proper model conversion in future

#### ✅ Model Warm-up Fix
**Fixed**: Removed duplicate `unsqueeze(0)` - input already has correct shape `[1, 2, 44100]`

## Test Updates

### Fixed Tests
- `test_worker_queue_manager.py`: Fixed `test_worker_status_set_to_waiting_on_queue`
  - Test now properly blocks queue before checking WAITING status
- `test_mdx_scanner.py`: Added missing config fields (`hysteresis_ms`, `early_stop_tolerance_ms`)
- `test_vocal_window.py`: Updated expected defaults (30/15/90 → 20/10/60)

### Test Results
**329/329 tests passing** ✅

## Performance Impact

**Expected Improvements**:
1. **Tighter windows (20/10/60)**: ~33% faster initial scanning
2. **Early-stop (500ms)**: Eliminates unnecessary continued scanning
3. **Provider reuse**: Removes 2-3 redundant model loads (~5-15s saved per detection)
4. **TF32 on CUDA**: ~1.5-2x faster matrix operations on Ampere+ GPUs
5. **Better onset detection**: More accurate detection for gradual fade-ins

**Overall**: Estimated **2-3x faster** gap detection on CUDA with **improved accuracy**, especially for:
- Songs with gradual vocal fade-ins
- Songs with complex instrumental intros
- Songs where metadata gap is close to actual gap

## Known Issues

### FP16 Disabled
- Mixed precision (FP16) caused type mismatch errors with Demucs
- Disabled until proper model conversion implemented
- TF32 still provides good acceleration on modern GPUs

### QPixmap Warnings
- "QPixmap::scaled: Pixmap is a null pixmap" warnings in GUI
- Non-critical, doesn't affect functionality
- Related to image loading/scaling in UI

## Migration Guide

### For Users
1. **No action required** - Config will auto-update with new defaults
2. **Recommended**: Test gap detection on previously problematic songs
3. **If issues persist**: See `docs/mdx-detection-tuning.md` for manual tuning

### For Developers
1. **Config changes**: Update any hardcoded default values
2. **Provider usage**: Pass provider parameter to pipeline functions
3. **FP16**: Do not enable until type mismatch resolved
