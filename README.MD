# Ultrastar Deluxe (USDX) Fix Gap Gui

**Automatically fix timing issues in your UltraStar karaoke songs using AI-powered gap detection!**

Ultrastar Deluxe (USDX) Fix Gap Gui helps you quickly verify and correct GAP values in your UltraStar song collection. The GAP value defines when lyrics start (in milliseconds) - getting it right is crucial for a great karaoke experience.

### **Why do you need this?**

When downloading songs from [USDB](https://usdb.animux.de/) using [USDB Syncer](https://github.com/bohning/usdb_syncer), audio files are created from YouTube videos. This can cause timing mismatches:
- YouTube videos may have intro variations
- Community-set GAP values may not match your downloaded video
- Manual verification of hundreds of songs is time-consuming

**This tool solves these problems automatically** using AI to detect when vocals actually start, then suggests the correct GAP value with visual confirmation.

### **How it works**

1. **Load your song collection** - point to your UltraStar songs folder
2. **Detect gaps** - AI analyzes audio and finds vocal onset timing
3. **Review results** - see waveform visualization with detected vs. original GAP
4. **Apply fixes** - accept suggested values or fine-tune manually

The app uses state-of-the-art AI vocal separation (Meta's Demucs) with smart chunked processing to find the exact moment vocals start.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- üéØ **AI-Powered Detection** - Uses Meta's Demucs for accurate vocal onset detection
- ‚ö° **GPU Acceleration** - Optional NVIDIA GPU support for 5-10x faster processing ([Setup Guide](docs/gpu-acceleration.md))
- üìä **Visual Waveforms** - See exactly where vocals start with clear visualizations
- üéöÔ∏è **Audio Normalization** - Automatic volume adjustment for consistent playback
- üìà **Confidence Scoring** - Know how reliable each detection is
- üîÑ **Batch Processing** - Fix hundreds of songs automatically
- üéµ **Preview Generation** - Listen to detected timing before applying changes
- üíæ **Smart Caching** - Re-analyze only what changed, save time on re-runs
- üëÅÔ∏è **Watch Mode** - Automatically monitor your song directory for changes and keep cache up-to-date

### **Detection Methods**

Choose the detection method that fits your needs:

- **MDX** (Recommended) - Fast GPU-accelerated chunked scanning with Meta's Demucs
  - ‚ö° 10-30 seconds per song with GPU
  - üéØ Smart early-stop when onset found
  - üÜï Latest AI technology

- **Spleeter** (Legacy) - Full stem separation
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecated (unmaintained since 2020)
  - ~30-60 seconds per song
  - Requires TensorFlow dependencies

- **HQ Segment** (Legacy) - Windowed Spleeter
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecated (wrapper around unmaintained Spleeter)
  - ~15-25 seconds per song

> üí° **Tip**: Use MDX with GPU acceleration for best performance. See [GPU Acceleration Guide](docs/gpu-acceleration.md) for setup instructions.

5. **(Optional) Enable Watch Mode**
   - After loading songs, click the "Watch Mode" button
   - The app will monitor your song directory for changes:
     - New songs added ‚Üí automatically scanned and added to the list
     - Songs deleted ‚Üí removed from cache and list
     - Songs moved/renamed ‚Üí cache updated with new paths
     - .txt/.mp3/.wav modified ‚Üí gap detection automatically queued
   - Changes are debounced (500ms default) to avoid processing storms
   - Watch mode persists until manually disabled or app is closed

### **Interface Overview**

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Song Table** | Shows all loaded songs with detection results |
| **Waveform Display** | Visual representation of audio with GAP markers |
| **Media Player** | Preview audio and navigate to specific timestamps |
| **Task Queue** | View ongoing/queued detection tasks |
| **Log Viewer** | Troubleshoot issues and monitor processing |
| **Watch Mode Button** | Toggle filesystem monitoring for automatic updates |

### **Understanding Results**

**Status Column**:
- ‚úÖ **MATCH** - Detected GAP matches original (within tolerance)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **MISMATCH** - Significant difference detected, review recommended
- üîÑ **PROCESSING** - Detection in progress
- ‚ùå **ERROR** - Detection failed, check logs

**Confidence Score**:
- **0.8-1.0** - Very confident, safe to auto-apply
- **0.6-0.8** - Good, manual review recommended
- **0.4-0.6** - Uncertain, definitely review
- **<0.4** - Low confidence, consider re-detecting or manual timing

> üí° **Tip**: Sort by "Diff" column to find songs with largest timing errors first!

### **Watch Mode**

Watch Mode provides real-time monitoring of your song directory, automatically keeping your cache and gap detections up-to-date as you add, modify, or remove songs.

**Features**:
- üîç **Automatic Discovery** - New songs are instantly scanned and added
- üîÑ **Smart Updates** - Modified .txt or audio files trigger targeted gap detection
- üóëÔ∏è **Cache Sync** - Deleted or moved songs are removed from cache
- ‚ö° **Debouncing** - Rapid changes are coalesced to prevent processing storms
- üéØ **Targeted Scanning** - Only changed songs are processed, not the entire directory

**How to Use**:
1. Load your song directory normally
2. Wait for initial scan to complete
3. Click "Watch Mode" button to enable (button becomes checkable and highlighted)
4. Make changes to your song directory (add/edit/delete songs)
5. Changes are automatically detected and processed
6. Click "Watch Mode" again to disable when done

**What's Monitored**:
- **Created** - New .txt files or folders ‚Üí scheduled for scanning and cache update
- **Modified** - .txt/.mp3/.wav files ‚Üí gap detection automatically queued
- **Deleted** - Songs removed ‚Üí cache entries deleted, UI updated
- **Moved/Renamed** - Songs relocated ‚Üí treated as delete + create

**Performance**:
- Uses OS-native filesystem monitoring (Windows ReadDirectoryChangesW, macOS FSEvents, Linux inotify)
- Default 500ms debounce prevents excessive processing during bulk operations
- Ignored patterns (.tmp, ~, .crdownload, .part) filter out temporary files
- At-most-one detection task per song prevents duplicates

**Configuration** (`config.ini`):
```ini
[WatchMode]
watch_mode_default = false         # Set to true to auto-enable on directory load
watch_debounce_ms = 500            # Wait time after last change before processing
watch_ignore_patterns = .tmp,~,.crdownload,.part  # Comma-separated patterns to ignore
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Watch Mode requires the `watchdog` library. This is included in the standard installation and executables.

method = mdx    # Recommended: mdx, spleeter (legacy), hq_segment (legacy)
```

**Adjust Gap Tolerance** (default: 500ms):
```ini
[Detection]
gap_tolerance = 500    # Milliseconds - gaps larger than this are flagged as MISMATCH
```

**Suppress GPU Pack Dialog** (if you don't want GPU acceleration):
```ini
[General]
GpuPackDialogDontShow = true
```

**Watch Mode Settings**:
```ini
[WatchMode]
watch_mode_default = false         # Auto-enable watch mode on directory load
