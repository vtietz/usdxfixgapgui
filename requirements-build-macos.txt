# Build-time dependencies for macOS builds
# This file uses standard PyTorch (no +cpu suffix needed on macOS)
#
# For development, use requirements.txt instead
# For GPU development: run.bat install --gpu

# ===== Runtime dependencies (shared base) =====
-r requirements-base.txt

# ===== PyTorch - macOS standard versions =====
# macOS doesn't use +cpu suffix, just standard version numbers
# PyTorch for macOS includes MPS (Metal Performance Shaders) support
