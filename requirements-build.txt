# Build-time dependencies for CI/CD pipelines
# This file pins CPU-only PyTorch to ensure small executable sizes (~350-500 MB)
#
# For development, use requirements.txt instead (allows GPU PyTorch)
# For GPU development: run.bat install --gpu

# ===== Runtime dependencies (shared base) =====
-r requirements-base.txt

# ===== PyTorch - CPU-only for builds =====
# Using CPU-only versions to minimize executable size
# GPU Pack system provides optional CUDA acceleration at runtime
# NOTE: Workflow installs these with --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
