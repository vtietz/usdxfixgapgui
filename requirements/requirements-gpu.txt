# GPU development convenience file (optional)
#
# Use together with the CUDA wheel index URL to install CUDA-enabled PyTorch.
# This should NOT be used for building the distributable; builds use CPU-only.
#
# Example install:
#   pip install -r requirements-gpu.txt --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
#
# If your GPU Pack uses CUDA 12.4, change cu121 -> cu124 and version suffixes accordingly.

-r requirements-base.txt

# Pin to the same versions used by the GPU Pack for consistency
torch==2.4.1+cu121
torchaudio==2.4.1+cu121
