# Build-time dependencies for Linux CI/CD
# This file pins CPU-only PyTorch to ensure small executable sizes (~250 MB)
#
# CRITICAL: torch and torchaudio MUST have +cpu suffix on Linux
# to avoid pulling 1GB+ of CUDA dependencies

# ===== Runtime dependencies (shared base) =====
-r requirements-base.txt

# ===== PyTorch - CPU-only builds (MUST be pinned with +cpu suffix) =====
torch==2.4.1+cpu
